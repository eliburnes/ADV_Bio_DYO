ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -10441.329 NNIs 39 max delta 5.18 Time 2.90
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.985 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
