ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -9737.412 NNIs 44 max delta 6.44 Time 3.06
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.981 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
